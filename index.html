    <h3>How does Inner Join Work?</h3>
    <p>
        Inner join is an SQL, structured query language, command which returns a table with the records that have matching values in a common column between two tables. For example, if one table held the names and favorite colors of 15 people, and another table held the names and favorite animals for just 5 of those people, an inner join would return a table with the names, favorite colors, and favorite animals, of just the five people that the two tables had in common. The commands would look something like this:

    </p>
    <pre>
    SELECT  table1.Color, table2.Animal, table1.Name
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.Name = table2.Name
    </pre>

    <h3> What is a data Scientist?</h3>
        
    <p>A data scientist looks for meaning in a data set and makes discoveries based on the data, relevant questions, and hypothesis. One of the key similarities with a computer scientist is that a data scientist needs some basic coding skills, and often needs to understand and be able to use advanced algorithms in order to extract meaning from the data. Data science is a very interdisciplinary concept, however, and requires skills well beyond working with computers. Data scientists often need to have an understanding of statistics, a grasp on the concepts in play, and a good amount of creativity in order to harness the power of the data. Communication skills are also very important in order to understand what kind of information to analyze and then convey their findings in a meaningful and effective manner.
